# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is primarily focused on audio processing, specifically converting audio files into spectrograms and extracting Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The project utilizes Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and Python scripts for processing tasks. The main libraries likely used in this project include libraries for audio processing (such as librosa), data manipulation (like pandas), and visualization (possibly matplotlib or seaborn).

## Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - librosa (for audio processing)
  - pandas (for data manipulation)
  - numpy (for numerical operations)
  - matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to preprocess audio files for machine learning tasks, specifically by converting audio into spectrograms and extracting relevant features such as MFCCs. This is essential for tasks like audio classification or recognition.
